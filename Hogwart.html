                      Do you like nature? Great! As you walk around our grounds you will quickly learn that nature here doesn't like you!<br/>

                      Get up close and personal with our willow tree and discover that you never truly get a day off from life threatening situations around here.<br/>

                      Do you like spiders? Great! We have GIANT hairy ones that you can totally chat to before experiencing the thrill of running for your life.</p>

                    <p><strong>Danger!</strong><br/>
                      Yeah, you could go to a normal school and feel all safe... <br/>
                      Or you could come here where we will actively throw you in to life threatening situations!<br/>
                      We will ease you in gently, where you will enjoy the delights of backfiring spells exploding in your face. 
                      From there we will progress you to fighting an assortment of dangerous creatures. 
                      You may even get the opportunity to risk your life against huge dragons for sport! Cool as, right?<br/>
                      Even some of our staff are happy to concuss you with a book if you don't look like you're studying.
                      next to each other.</p>

                      You'll also have an amazing time learning politics as your enemy takes control of the government and turns the whole world against you!<br/>
